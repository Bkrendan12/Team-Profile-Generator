## Tech Used

html, css, javascript, node.js

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple note taking application where the user can keep track of his notes for the week. I would personally use it as a weekly planner, but it is at heart a simple note taker so youre more than welcome to use it as you feel neccessary.

## GIVEN a note-taking application

```
WHEN I open the Terminal in Node.js
THEN I am presented with prompts asking about employee information

WHEN I the prompts are presented
THEN I am instructed to enter an amount of employees you want to add, their names, roles, github, email based on which employee you choose.

WHEN I finish filling out all the information for the employee cards
THEN an html file is generated in the file directory

WHEN I oepn the html in the browser
THEN I am presented with all of the cards the user generated in the node terminal
```
